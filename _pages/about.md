I am a first year Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor advised by Nikhil Bansal. I am interested in the theoretical aspects on the computer science, mainly in Algorithms and Discrete Math. I am currenly inclined towards some online and stochastic problems and I have spent some time working on problems like $k$-server, prophet inequalities, balanced allocation, etc. Before joining Grad school, I did my M.Tech. and B.Tech. in Computer Science at IIT Delhi, where I was fortunate to be advised by Ashish Chiplunkar.
